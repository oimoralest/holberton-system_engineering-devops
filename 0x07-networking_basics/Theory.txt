    OSI model
        The Open Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceprtual model
        that characterises and standardises the communication functions
        of a telecommunicaion or computing system without regard to its
        underlaying internal structure and technology.

        The model partitions the fflow data in a communication system into
        seven abstraction layers, from the physical implementation of
        transmiting bits across a communications medium to the
        highest-level representation of data of a distributed application.
