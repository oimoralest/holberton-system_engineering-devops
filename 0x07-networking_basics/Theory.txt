    OSI model
        The Open Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceprtual model
        that characterises and standardises the communication functions
        of a telecommunicaion or computing system without regard to its
        underlaying internal structure and technology.

        The model partitions the fflow data in a communication system into
        seven abstraction layers, from the physical implementation of
        transmiting bits across a communications medium to the
        highest-level representation of data of a distributed application.

	Layer architecture
	      The recommendation X.200 describees the following layers:

	      Media layers:
	      	    1 Physical:Protocol data unit:Bit, Symbol
		      function: Transmission and reception of raw bit
		      over a physical medium
		    2 Data link:Protocol data unit:Frame
		      function: Reliable transmission of data frames
		      between two nodes connecttedd by a physical layer
		    3 Network:Protocol data unit:Packet
		      function: Structuring and managing a multi-node
		      network, inluding addresing, routing and traffic
		      control
	      Host layers:
	      	    4 Transport:Protocol data unit:Segment, Datagram
		      function: Reliable transmission of data segments
		      between points on a network, including segmentattion,
		      acknowledgement and multiplexing
		    5 Session:Protocol data unit:Data
		      function: Managing communication sessions, i.e,
		      continuos exchange of information in the form of
		      multiple back-and-forth transmissions between two
		      nodes
		    6 Presentation:Protocol data unit:Data
		      function: Translation of data between a networking
		      service and an application; including character
		      encoding, data compression and encryption/decryption
		    7 Application:Protocol data unit:Data
		      function: High-level APIs, including resource
		      sharing, remote file access
